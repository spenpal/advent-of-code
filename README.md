# Advent of Code

I started doing Advent of Code hoping to become a better Python programmer than the year before. Feel free to check my progress and how my code has evolved! I am constantly learning new ways to program in Python, and using efficient and interesting tricks to make my code more readable, writeable, and exploit a faster runtime. You might find a thing or two that you have never seen used practically in Python before ðŸ‘€...

I don't use comments for the majority of my code, as the code should be well written enough that it explains itself (*at least in the context of knowing the puzzle*).
